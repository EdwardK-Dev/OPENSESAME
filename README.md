# OpenSESA

**OpenSESA (Open Systems Engineering and Safety Assurance)** is a web-based application purpose-built to **manage system complexity** through a structured Systems Engineering and Safety Assurance (SESA) framework.  
It provides a unified model for how systems are defined, related, integrated, and assured — ensuring that complexity remains visible, traceable, and controllable across the entire project lifecycle.

## Managing System Complexity
Complex engineering programs often struggle with fragmented data: multiple stakeholders, conflicting baselines, evolving designs, and unclear ownership.  
OpenSESA addresses this by embedding **SESA principles** directly into its data model and workflows.

### 1. System Definition and Decomposition
- Define systems, subsystems, and components in a structured **System Breakdown Structure (SBS)**.  
- Capture attributes such as function, boundaries, ownership, and lifecycle phase.  
- Maintain traceability between system elements, requirements, and assurance evidence.  
This enables clear scope allocation and eliminates ambiguity in what each system “is” and “does”.

### 2. Interface and Dependency Management
- Record and visualise **interfaces** between systems, disciplines, and organisations.  
- Track data, energy, control, or physical connections as explicit, versioned objects.  
- Highlight dependency density and identify integration risks early.  
Interfaces are treated as first-class data entities — a key SESA practice for complexity control.

### 3. Configuration State and Change Control
- Represent evolving **configuration states** (e.g. design, integration, commissioning).  
- Link each system and interface to its active baseline.  
- Manage and audit change impacts between baselines.  
This provides a stable mechanism to manage evolving designs while retaining full traceability.

### 4. Risk and Assurance Traceability
- Associate **hazards, risks, and assurance evidence** directly to the responsible systems.  
- Support safety and cybersecurity alignment with standards such as EN 50126, IEC 62443, and ISO 31000.  
- Generate trace matrices linking risk mitigations to configuration and design decisions.  
This ensures that assurance activities evolve with system maturity, not in isolation from it.

### 5. Multi-Stakeholder Agreement and Review
- Capture and track **comments, discussions, and resolutions** between project partners.  
- Manage alignment activities (e.g. during design reviews or integration workshops).  
- Record consensus outcomes as formalised “agreed items” tied to specific system elements or interfaces.  
This reduces miscommunication and provides verifiable evidence of agreement — critical for multi-party governance.

## How OpenSESA Implements SESA
| SESA Element | OpenSESA Implementation |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| **System Definition** | Architecture and breakdown structures with ownership and attributes |
| **Interface Management** | Typed and versioned interface instances linking systems |
| **Configuration Control** | Baseline and state tracking across lifecycle stages |
| **Safety Assurance** | Integrated hazard, control, and evidence tracking |
| **Change Management** | Version history, audit logs, and cross-domain impact analysis |
| **Collaboration** | Comment and agreement workflows tied to artefacts |

## Purpose
OpenSESA brings SESA theory into practice by providing a **living digital model** of how systems interact, evolve, and are assured.  
Its goal is to reduce complexity not by simplifying systems, but by **making complexity structured, visible, and manageable** — aligning every decision with the lifecycle processes defined in **ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288**.
